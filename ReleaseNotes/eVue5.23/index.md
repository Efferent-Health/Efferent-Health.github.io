## Introduction

Welcome to the August 2024 release of Efferent eVue and eFit. In this update, we've focused on improving several features.

## New Features

None

## Improvements

### eFit on Stitch images

The Stitch & Resect tool allows to select one or more images from a study to create a composite image. Users have the option to perform cropping and apply basic transformations such as rotation and flip. With this update, it will be possible to conduct eFit planning for the hip on a stitched image using AI and autocalibration services.

### Confirmation dialog  when uploading a Dicom/MP4 without data

Added a message that pops up if the user selects the option “empty” in all patient information fields (PID, Patient Name, DOB) when uploading a Dicom or mp4. The message asks for confirmation to upload the study with all patient data empty.

### Offline and Hybrid mode for SmartLink 5

#### Hybrid mode: 
eVue shall detect a local SmartLink and retrieve the study images from the SmartLink installed in the same user network, this will increase the downloading experience of the studies by a factor of 5X-7X.
 
#### Offline mode:
In case eVue detects no connection with the Efferent cloud platform, the user will be notified to switch to offline mode. This feature will allow to keep working with the studies stored locally on SmartLink 5.

### Improvement of image rendering

The image rendering has been improved to use a higher quality when showing the entire image on the viewport.
