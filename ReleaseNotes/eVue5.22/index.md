## Bug Fixes

- **The W/L values were not set correctly for CL images**: Multiframe images in CL were not displayed with the correct Window/Level and therefore looked too bright. Some parameters in CL that were being considered as in HD have been corrected. 

- **PR modality icon in the Split view**: When doing a Split, the PR modality icon was not displayed correctly in the series display view.

- **Correction in the printing scale for series and complete studies**: The scale factor is now correctly applied when rescaling the images for display in the PDF generated by the quick print function.

- **Correction in scrolling while the magnifier is active**: The magnifier displays only the image on which it was positioned before starting the scrolling action.

## Deprecations
