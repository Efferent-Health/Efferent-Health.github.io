## Introduction

Welcome to the December 2024 release of Efferent eVue and eFit. In this update, we have focused on optimizing the performance of the most frequently used features and fixing issues identified in  workflows.
## Improvements

### SmartShare 

Improvements have been made to the presentation of Smartshare options, optimizing the functionality's workflows. The changes include:

- **Reorganization of Practitioner Sharing Options:** Users can now send studies to a practitioner registered within an organization or to an external practitioner by selecting the desired option.
- **Enhanced "Recents" Option:** Now presented as "Recents and Favorites," this feature displays a list of the last 10 practitioners and patients with whom studies were shared, along with those marked as favorites.
- **Updated Anonymization Feature:** Previously, studies could be anonymized when sharing with practitioners by selecting a checkbox. Now, studies can be shared anonymously using the "Share Anonymized" button, not only with practitioners but also when using the "With Organization" option.

### Autosizing for Knee Implants



## Bug Fixes

- **Filter by body part could not be executed**: A problem was fixed that caused an error when performing a body part search using the Filter tool.

- **The drag point of the "Show in print" table disappeared**: When placing the transischial line, adding an implant, and attempting to drag it, the implant would instantly move to an unexpected position in the viewport.
