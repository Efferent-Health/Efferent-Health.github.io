### HIPAA warning for Dummy guests

The HIPAA warning has been implemented for dummy guests. These users will now be required to accept HIPAA conditions when opening a shared link or QR, protecting shared patient information.

### "Save as key image" option for Knee

The "Save key image" option has been added for knee to generate key images directly. This access allows to save implant options while using the eFit tool and then continue modifying the current one. 

This speeds up the creation and saving of multiple templates, which previously could be done by saving the current implant, closing the efit window and then creating the key image with Image tools.
