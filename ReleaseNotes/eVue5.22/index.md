## Bug Fixes

- **The W/L values were not set correctly for CL images**: Multiframe images in CL were not being displayed with the correct W/L and therefore looked too bright. Some parameters in CL that were being considered as in HD have been corrected. 

- **PR modality icon in the Split view**: When doing a Split, the PR modality icon was not displayed correctly in the series display view.

- **Correction in the printing scale for series and complete studies**: The scale factor is now correctly applied when rescaling the images for display in the PDF generated by the quick print function.

- **Correction in scrolling while the magnifier is active**:  Through the magnifier, only the image on which it was positioned before starting the scrolling action was displayed.

## Deprecations

None

## Known Issues



## Upcoming Features
